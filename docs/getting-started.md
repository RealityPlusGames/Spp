# Getting Started with S++
## Getting the code on your computer
### Download a .ZIP file
Go to https://github.com/RealityPlusGames/Spp. There should be a button named "Code". Click it. At the bottom of the dropdwn it should say Download Zip. Voila. :white_check_mark:

### In your code editor - without downloading
###### | *This is based on the repl.it code editor. May not work on all code editors.
You can use two ways, both explained here:
#### #1
You can use a script tag, with raw.githubusercontent.com [(link here)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RealityPlusGames/Spp/master/src/v1.0.0/min/main.min.css)
This would be the code, with version 1.0.0, minimum syntax, in your ```css``` file.
```css
/* If you downloaded: */
import url("./path/to/your/downloaded/file.css")
/* If you didn't download: */
import url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RealityPlusGames/Spp/master/src/v1.0.0/min/main.min.css")
```
#### #2
This would be your code with version 1.0.0, minimum syntax, in your ```html``` file.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My First S++ App!</title>
    <!-- If you downloaded, the href attribute should be your path! -->
    <link type="text/css" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RealityPlusGames/Spp/master/src/v1.0.0/min/main.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
   </head>
   <body>
     <!-- All of your S++ code goes here -->
   </body>
</html>
```
